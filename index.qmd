R Coding Club is an informal time to chat and learn some new skills. The
topic of each session

For most sessions, our process is that one person is the "driver" and
one person is the "navigator". The driver shares their screen and types
in the code, while the navigator tells the driver what to do and what
code to type. Usually, the driver is a beginner and the navigator is
someone with more experience.

While we record and upload the session to YouTube, to improve knowledge
sharing, we also create a blog post on what we covered during the
session. Part of the purpose of making a blog post is to solidify
knowledge learned by the driver, so they will be responsible for writing
the blog. To add a post, read through:

1.  The section on creating blogs in the [making
    websites](posts/making-websites/index.qmd#create-blogs) blog.

2.  The sections
    [prerequisites](posts/branches-and-actions/index.qmd#prerequisites),
    [forking and cloning](posts/branches-and-actions/index.qmd#forking),
    [create a
    branch](posts/branches-and-actions/index.qmd#create-branch), and
    [create a pull
    request](posts/branches-and-actions/index.qmd#create-pr) on the
    [creating branches](posts/branches-and-actions/index.qmd) blog.
    Follow the code to add the blog file created in the point 1 above.
    **Do not** do anything related to the Actions that is described in
    this blog.
